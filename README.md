# Locate

This was a project I initially developed for [HackRU Spring 2015](http://hackru.org), Rutgers University's hackathon!

My project allows users to locate their friends in crowded public places by viewing their locations on a map in private online rooms.

I mainly used [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the backend and [socket.io's](http://socket.io/) client library for the frontend.

Check out [this link](https://locatefriends.herokuapp.com/) to view the project! Try using it with your friends the next time you lose track of them in a crowded place!
